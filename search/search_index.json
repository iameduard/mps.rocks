Inspired by awesome-python and awesome-rust . What Do You Want? Understand what MPS is What is MPS and why to build your own language See what others have been building with MPS Build with MPS are open source projects that all build on MPS Research contains a list academic papers that make heavy use of MPS Get started with building stuff on top of MPS To get stated we suggest to look at the tutorials in the following order Fast track tutorial is the official tutorial for MPS. It will provide you with an high-level overview in 10 steps, covering all aspects of MPS at a high level. MPS Intro Course by @markusvoelter is an advanced introduction to MPS in the form of multiple videos as well as a github repository to play around with. It also covers extensions to MPS such as additional notations or the interpreter framework. Grammar Cells An extension to the editor language of MPS. It will help you to create consistent and well-behaving textual notations in MPS with no effort. If you are specificly looking for input on how to build generators this guide contains a set of best practices. The DSL Engineering Book contains detailed discussions of the concepts behind MPS in its Part III on language implementation. For more details on specific MPS topics we refer to 2 books on MPS as well as the official MPS User Guide Learning contains a list of even more tutorials In addition Research contains a list academic papers that make heavy use of MPS Find existing extensions for MPS Awesome MPS contains a collection of extensions to MPS Get in touch with the community The Community list the usual subects Awesome MPS ANTLR_MPS - An ANTLR language for MPS, and the ToMPS language to help create MPS languages and ANTRL visitors from an ANTLR 4 grammar. mps-code-reviewer - Code Review for JetBrains MPS providing integration with Bitbucket ecmascript4mps - ECMAScript language implementation for JetBrains MPS Editor2PDF - Serialises editor into PDF files ingrid - Ingrid is a plugin for JetBrains MPS allowing import of ANTLRv4 grammars and create an MPS language out of it. MPS Extensions - Various extensions to simplify language development. MPS gradle plugin - A Gradle plugin to build & test langauges and to support various tasks related to custom RCP packaging. PlantUML - Language for PlantUML models, also useful to generate PlantUML diagrams from custom DSL. Simple Generator Editors - Simplified editors to increase readability of generators.
